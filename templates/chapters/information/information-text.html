        <h2>Information Security</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	Your personal information is something that is very important, and is also something that can be 
            easily <span class="tooltip">compromised<span class="text">When information is accessed by those who 
            shouldn't have access to it.</span></span> on the internet. Not everyone is out to be your friend, including companies, and 
            a lot of people are seeking your personal information. Keep this safe can be both simple and 
            complicated in certain regards, but this article will help you through the basics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	The most important factor when it comes to one's information security is keeping it safe from other people you 
            interact with online. Anything from your name to your banking information is all information that could lead to 
            potential security issues. Think of it this way: all of your information can in one way or another be used against you: 
            names in spam emails, emails in <span class="tooltip">email dumps<span class="text">A large list of emails gained from a 
            breach/leak, usually to be sold to spammers/companies.</span></span>, bank account info in regards to your bank account 
            being breached, etc.. Everything can and could potentially be used maliciously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	This part of your information security is actually really easy to protect yourself towards; simply donâ€™t 
            share any information. You might think that this is really obvious, but a lot of people do it. Sharing pictures 
            even as <span class="tooltip">inconspicuous<span class="text">Something that fits in, being so generic that it's easy to miss.
            </span></span> as boarding passes on social media for example can expose a lot of personal information. Now, 
            the easy thing to say is just to not use any platforms where one could share any of this accidently, but those 
            platforms are also often really fun to use. Because of this, trying your best not to share anything personal, 
            even your face, is generally a great idea. As technology progresses, things even as general like our voices can 
            be <span class="tooltip">deepfaked<span class="text">Using software, usually with AI (artificial intelligence), to 
            replicate someone's voice.</span></span> and used to access bank accounts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	Believe it or not, companies are also out for your information. Have you ever talked with your friends about a product, 
            and sooner or later you start getting online advertisements for it? Thatâ€™s right, theyâ€™re in the walls. In all actuality, 
            our devices are listening to us, and so our the websites we visit. Although itâ€™s hard to protect yourself from all forms 
            of snooping, you can reasonably take certain measures. When websites ask you if they can get access to certain data the 
            first time you visit, itâ€™s in your best practice to always deny them. <span class="tooltip">Personal data removal services
            <span class="text">Software/companies that remove your personal information from companies on the internet.
            </span></span> are good for handling companies that you already gave the permission to take your info, and 
            itâ€™s highly recommended to look into those. You can also do this manually, but it can be a long and difficult process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	Lastly, even though it doesnâ€™t directly fall into information security, maintaining your <span class="tooltip">digital footprint
            <span class="text">Software/companies that remove your personal information from companies on the internet.</span></span> is also 
            something that is very important. Everything you say online can be traced back to you easily, and potential employers and 
            schools look at this. Be careful on what you put online, because it will be viewed, and could be used against you if itâ€™s 
            something bad. Careers have been lost over this. Generally, one should be respectful on the internet, but it is especially 
            important for this reason.</p>
