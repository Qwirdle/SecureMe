        <h2>Malware Security</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	Weâ€™ve all heard of the term malware. <span class="tooltip">Malware<span class="text">Software that has 
            been created with malicious intent, usually causing harm to computer systems.</span></span> is any 
            software that has been created with malicious intent, usually in order to cause harm onto other computer 
            systems. Malware can be pretty devastating, because it can create problems on computers, not only for 
            major companies, but for normal people too. Whether itâ€™s <span class="tooltip">encrypting<span class="text">Encoding or 
            changing data with a key in order to make sure that it can't be read by any unwanted individuals.</span></span> all of the storage, or stealing 
            valuable information, knowing the dangers of and how to avoid malware is something thatâ€™s very important for everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	There are many types of malware that one should be aware of, as they all function and operate differently. 
            However, itâ€™s important to note that level of destruction is somewhat independent, as whatâ€™s actually being 
            done on an infested system, called the <span class="tooltip">payload<span class="text">What a piece of malware 
            does once it's on a system.</span></span> of the malware, doesnâ€™t directly correlate to how the malware got there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Viruses</strong> are malware that specifically spread through user interaction. This can usually be through spam, 
            ads, or downloading from websites that arenâ€™t secure. But in one way or another, user interaction is always involved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Worms</strong> are the opposite of viruses, as they spread through systems and networks by themselves, 
            through replication. Because of this, they tend to spread really quickly, and are rather destructive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Backdoors</strong> are malicious software that is able to get through security systems through a bug/hole, 
            allowing for easy access for any payload. Often they use <span class="tooltip">zero day exploits<span class="text">Exploits in a 
            software or operating system that have been discovered by bad actors, but not by the development team.</span></span>, which are 
            exploits that havenâ€™t been discovered yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Ransomware</strong> is malicious software that encrypts a computer's content, and then asks for money in order to get 
            the system decrypted. Generally they ask for payment through <span class="tooltip">cryptocurrency<span class="text">Digital currency 
            that is secured using cryptography, which is operated independently from government on a decentralized network.</span></span> 
            or other anonymous methods in order to avoid authorities tracking down the money, leading to the hackers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Spyware</strong> is the malware that will do the least initial damage to your computer, as instead of outright attacking your 
            computer, it instead stays in the background, recording information, traffic, <span class="tooltip">keystrokes<span class="text">Keyboard 
            inputs.</span></span>, and more. These can later be used to take passwords, and other information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	<strong>Trojan Horseâ€™s</strong> are malware that enter your system disguised as something safe, in order to bypass security. For example, 
            some Trojan Horseâ€™s wait a while till they activate, in order to avoid any initial detection/suspicion from <span class="tooltip">antivirus
            <span class="text">Software that combats any malware in your system.</span></span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	Because of the damage that malware can cause, avoiding it is something that is favorable. There are a couple things you can do, some 
            being in your control, and some out of your control, as some malware (like worms) donâ€™t need you to make a mistake in order to activate. 
            The most obvious way to avoid malware is to not use any suspicious websites, or download anything without being sure that itâ€™s what you 
            think it is. This is actually pretty easy, and if you havenâ€™t already itâ€™s pretty easy to distinguish nearly all malware downloads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
        <p>	However, sometimes we have no control, whether the malware is installed without any interaction from us, or if a website that was safe 
            beforehand was hacked without you knowledge, causing you to accidentally install a virus. This is where antivirus comes in, as antivirus is 
            powerful software that automatically helps to monitor and keep your computer safe. However, most commercial, if not all commercial antivirus, 
            is really intrusive any practically useless (Norton, etc.) Luckily, the most targeted operating system, windows, has a great built in 
            one, called <span class="tooltip">windows defender<span class="text">Windows built in antivirus software.</span></span>. This works great. 
            If you are using a mac or a phone, malware is still an issue but much less so because windows is the targeted operating system, also 
            being the most popular. You should still be careful, but malware is a bit less of a threat.</p>
